Reflection:
What inspired my branding are the modern purple tones used in other Canva designs. Although I used a palette generator, I spent a lot of time looking for the one I liked because there was a specific scheme I had in mind. For the logo, it was hard trying to do it manually in Canva, so I used other resources for help. In future projects, I want to use the palettes and typography to showcase my personal style and make my designs more cohesive. I also want to experiment with layouts and visuals that truly reflect my ideas and make my work stand out.
