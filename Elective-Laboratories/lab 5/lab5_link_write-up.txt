Write-up:
FileFlow is a web app designed to help students and professionals organize their digital files easily. The main users are people who struggle with scattered files and messy folders. I chose a clean layout with soft blue and light colors to make the interface simple and calming. The navigation is easy to understand, with clear buttons and a consistent design across screens. One challenge I faced was fitting all necessary features without cluttering the screens. If I had more time, not only would I include more practical features, but I would also improve the position of elements more because I feel like it’s too cramped in some areas. Overall, the prototype shows how FileFlow can improve productivity and reduce stress when managing digital materials.
