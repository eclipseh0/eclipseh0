The easiest design was the square poster because I only used text effects and some gradients to make it aesthetic. The branding elements I applied were the typography and the palette, although this was done more subtly. I ensured hierarchy through alignment and proportions. I made the heading larger and the body and subtitles shorter. Lastly, I learned how to effectively include important info when it comes to promoting events. I also realized that too much design can distract from the message. Keeping things simple actually makes the design stronger and clearer.
