For me, Balance is the most useful because of the way it helps the elements and overall design feel stable. The easiest part of Canva is changing the properties of colors and texts. It feels very intuitive. The hardest is aligning elements in a precise manner. Most of the time Canva likes to auto align and I am struggling on overriding it. What I learnt about visual communication is trying to convey ideas clearly and effectively through visuals, using colors, layout, typography, and hierarchy.
